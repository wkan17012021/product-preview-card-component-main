## Overview

A good project to keep practicing plain css.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Some accessible HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS 
- Flexbox for mobile-tablet
- CSS Grid for desktop
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Used aria-hidden attribute set to true for the strikethrough price so that it wouldn't get announced by screen readers. 
I took some time to go back over the css rules and compile the declarations where I saw repeats. 

### Continued development

I wanted to try a different way of displaying the main image rather than using img or picture tags, so this was a good excuse to practice using background css properties. 

### Useful resources

- General google searches when I couldn't remember how the properties worked.
- Also, this blog showed me an application for using aria-hidden attribute: [Steve Bosworth Shopify Blog](https://ux.shopify.com/how-much-is-that-t-shirt-in-the-browser-window-5804d9043ad8)
